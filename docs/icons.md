I used Inkscape (1.0rc) to create the icon. Nick Saporito has some [guidelines]
for icon development for ios and android apps and a great [video] on creating icons
using [inkscape].

In the [icon_source](./icon_source) directory is the icon source file [inkscape.svg](./inkscape.svg) and the
[export.bat](./export.bat) batch file I used to export two grouped objects to icons of various sizes.
